- Simulation logic lives in pure TS under src/lib/sim (algorithms, workload, validation) with vitest tests; UI only calls it — keeps algorithms testable.
- Theme uses a `.dark` class on <html> set by an inline head script from localStorage; all colors are tokens in src/styles.css — avoids flash and hardcoded colors.
